I think this subject is very interesting and I think a lot of others would agree. On average 1.6 million tune in to watch NBA regular season games across widely known tv streaming services. This does not include clips on social media or other platforms which many basketball fans use to keep up with the NBA""")

with st.expander("Hypothesis Model"):
  st.write("""The Player's statistics: The most important factor in predicting the NBA ROTY is the player's statistics. The model could take into account the player's points per game (PPG), rebounds per game (RPG), assists per game (APG), steals per game (SPG), blocks per game (BPG), efficiency (EFF), and so much more!""")

with st.expander("Dataset Descriptions"):
  st.write("""Historical Data: The NBA has a wealth of historical data on players, teams, and games, which can be used to identify patterns and trends in the performance of rookies over the years.
Predictive Modeling: A linear regression model can help predict which rookies are most likely to win the award based on their performance in various statistical categories, such as points per game, rebounds, assists, and field goal percentage.
Objective Evaluation: By using a data-driven approach, you can eliminate bias and subjectivity in the evaluation process, and focus solely on the statistical performance of the players.
Better Decision-Making: With a reliable model in place, you can make more informed decisions on which rookies to draft, trade, or sign in free agency, based on their potential to win the Rookie of the Year award and contribute to your team's success.
Competitive Advantage: By leveraging data and analytics to make smarter decisions, you can gain a competitive advantage over other teams that rely on more traditional scouting methods.
